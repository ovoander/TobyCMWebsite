                    Hey there! My name is Toby Cm, I am very passionate about
                    coding. I mainly code in Python, Typescript, and Javascript,
                    but I will dabble around in HTML and CSS when needed. I

                    I have developed both of these projects along with others,
                    and are a demonstration of my development skills. I'm also
                    interested in video games, although I'm not that good at
                    them. I mainly play CS-2(Counter-Strike), but I'll sometimes
                    play Fortnite and other games, but not very often. I am
                    still enrolled in highschool, so I cannot pursue coding as
                    my career quite yet, but someday, I will. I hope you find
                    what your are looking for on this website, but if you
                    haven't, please contact me at:
